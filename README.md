# my_first_project
## This is my first project.

Here I will write and upload some cool shit.

Things like:
1. This...
2. and this...
3. and more of this...

### I will learn HTML, CSS, Javascript first.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
Some other languages I might learn:

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
```ruby
s = "Ruby syntax highlighting"
print s
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```
